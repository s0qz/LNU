'''Problem:
Assume a unit circle centred around origin inside a square with sides 2 like in the figure above.
Assume also that we randomly generate N points (x,y) where both x and y are within the range [- 1,1].
The proportion of points inside the circle should then approximately be the same as the ratio between the circle area piRR
(which equals pi since R=1) and the square area 4. This relation can be used to compute an approximation of pi.
Write a program pi_approx.py that computes (and prints) a pi approximation for N=100, N=10000, and N=1000000.
Print also the error (i.e. the absolute value of pi_actual - pi_approx).
